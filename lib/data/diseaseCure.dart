    'disease': 'Apple scab',
    'cure': 'Your best bet to prevent apple scab is to choose one of the disease-resistant varieties. Their resistance usually ranges from moderately resistant to very resistant. \n If you have your mind set on a variety that is susceptible to apple scab, plant a dwarf or semi-dwarf tree, which will allow you to apply a preventative fungicide on the entire tree (more about that below). \n Proper sanitation is key to prevent the spread of the fungus. Thoroughly remove fallen leaves, not only in the fall, but also during the growing season. If apple scab is present, do not throw those leaves in the compost but dispose of them in the garbage. \n Pruning is another important measure to control apple scab. In a tree with an open canopy where the leaves can dry quickly after a spring shower, the spores are less likely to germinate. \n Spraying an infected tree with a fungicide is only an option if the tree has lost most of its leaves for three or more consecutive years.',
